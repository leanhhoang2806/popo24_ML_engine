Step 4. Adopt Bylaws

The corporate bylaws contain much more detail
than the articles of incorporation. They spell out the
rights and powers of the shareholders, directors,
and officers of the corporation.
  Typically the bylaws state the time and place for
the annual meeting of shareholders, how much no-
tice of the meeting is given, and what constitutes a
quorum. There are also provisions for special meet-
ings to consider issues so important they can’t wait
for the next annual meeting and a statement about

    Mark: Sometimes used to refer to both a trademark and a service mark, because the terms are nearly,
       but not completely, interchangeable.

    Corporate Name: The name of a corporation as registered with one or more states. Examples: Time Inc.;
       Sony Corporation. The corporate name refers to the corporation only, and not to any product or
       services it offers.

    Trade Name or Business Name: The name used to identify a business, as distinct from the product or ser-
       vice it offers. It may be the same as the product or service name; for example, Sony Corporation
       sells electronic equipment under the Sony trademark; McDonald’s Corporation uses the service
       mark McDonald’s on its fast-food service. Or the trade name or business name may be different—
       for example, General Motors Corporation sells cars under the Buick trademark.

    Assumed Name or Fictitious Name: A business name different from the owner’s name. Example: Laura does
       business as Coffee Express. Partnerships and (in many states) corporations may also use assumed
       or fictitious names. In most places, you must register a fictitious name. (See Section B3.)

    Federal Trademark Register: A list of all trademarks and service marks registered with the federal govern-
       ment. To be accepted, a trademark or service mark must be distinctive and not confusingly similar
       to an existing mark. All states maintain trademark registers too, and some maintain service mark
       registers; preexisting federal trademark rights have priority.

                                           LETTER OF INTENT TO PURCHASE

Robert Tower, President
The Tower Mart Inc.
25 Glen Blvd.
Arlington Heights, IL

Dear Bob:

    Thanks for meeting with me again last week. I continue to be interested in purchasing the
assets of the Tower Mart Inc. If we reach an agreement regarding my purchase, I plan to transfer
these assets to a new corporation that I’m forming. My new company would then run a conve-
nience store similar to what you’re currently operating.

    I’m interested in purchasing the following assets: the inventory, fixtures, equipment,
leasehold improvements, and business name. In addition, I will need all necessary licenses
and permits transferred to me. I will expect you to give me a covenant not to compete stating
that for three years, you won’t open a similar store in our city. The purchase price for all
of the assets as well as the goodwill and your covenant not to compete would be $150,000, as
we have already discussed.

    [Before referring to a covenant not to compete, see the discussion of such covenants in
Section G5, below]

    As an indication of my good faith in pursuing this matter, I am enclosing a check for
$1,000 as earnest money. I would pay an additional $49,000 in cash at closing. The balance
of $100,000 would be amortized in equal monthly installments over a period of 10 years with
interest at the rate of 10% per annum.

    Regarding the inventory, we will check this at the time of closing. If the inventory is
valued at less than $45,000, the purchase price would be reduced accordingly. Also, as you
and I discussed, your corporation would remain responsible for all liabilities of the present
business and these would not be assumed by my new corporation.

    Before I have my lawyer draft a sales agreement, there are some things I need to investigate:
    1. I want to meet with your landlord to make sure that I can take over the existing lease
and that I can get an option to extend it for another five years.
    2. I need to have my accountant review all of your tax returns and business records for
the past five years so that I can satisfy myself regarding the financial condition of your
business.
    3. I want to make sure that the state liquor board will approve a transfer of the beer and
wine retail license to my new corporation.
    Assuming that I’m satisfied with these items and all other aspects of the proposed purchase,
I will have my lawyer draft a sales agreement and then we can close approximately 45 days from now.

    This letter states my intent but it is not a legally binding contract or commitment on either
my part or yours. Upon further investigation I may change my mind. If the deal doesn’t go
through for any reason, I’d be entitled to my earnest money back.

    If my letter has captured the essence of what we talked about and you’re still interested
in pursuing the sale, please let me know. I believe that we are moving toward a transaction
that can be advantageous to both of us.

Sincerely,


Mary Beyer
